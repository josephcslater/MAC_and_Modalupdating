function vtb1()
% Directory of chapter 1 toolbox codes. 
%
% VTB1_1 plots the free response of a single-degree of freedom
%        system.
% VTB1_2 numerically integrates to find the unforced response 
%        of a system using Euler's method.  The system can
%        be in state space or LSOM form.
% VTB1_3 performs fourth order Runge-Kutta integration on differential
%        equation.
%        equations need not be linear.
% VTB1_4 numerically integrates to find the forced response 
%        of a system using Euler's method.  The system can
%        be in state space or LSOM form.
% VTB1_5 plots the free decay of a single degree of freedom
%        system with viscous, coulomb, or air damping.
