Contributing code
-----------------
To contribute code we recommend you follow these steps:

#. Fork the repository on github

4. Clone the repository to your favorite location on your drive where you want to work on it. You never want to clone again.

#. Use Matlab's `addpath` command to add the vtoolbox directory to your installation of Matlab. Alternatively, use the GUI `pathtool`.

#.  Add your code/make your modifications, committing to your fork.

#. `Update from the main repository <https://www.sitepoint.com/quick-tip-sync-your-fork-with-the-original-without-the-cli/>`_ before submitting a pull request. This allows you to see the complete results before we look at them.  If it doesn't work, the pull will (should) be denied.

#. Sync to your computer (called `Fetch origin` in the new GitHub app.)

#. Make a git pull (in your GitHub app) to assure that your code is up to date with the master branch and that your code has no conflicts with the current base. Doing this regularly ensures that your accumulated edits won't be massively in conflict with the existing code base. After that, commit your branch to github and then open a pull request.

Installing
----------

If you are just trying to install:

4. Clone the vibration toolbox repository to your favorite location on your drive where you want to work on it. You never want to clone again.

#. Use Matlab's `addpath` command to add the vtoolbox directory to your installation of Matlab. Alternatively, use the GUI `pathtool`.

#. Sync to your computer (called `Fetch origin` in the new GitHub app.) to get updates.
